Four contestants, all of whom are seated in one of the wildest audiences in daytime game-show history, are called to the stage to play a preliminary pricing round. That winner joins the host on stage for one of more than 70 different pricing games. After three such games, the contestants spin a big wheel -- hoping to get as close to $1 as possible -- in the \"Showcase Showdown\". The two highest winners of that round advance to the final, where prizes could be cars or roomsful of furniture.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naÃ¯ve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd 9-year-old brother. Finally, there's Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, who sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. For 10 years on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy gives us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.</p>","updated":1586961423,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/26020"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1813317"},"nextepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1814113"}}},"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1814113"}}},{"id":1824389,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/1824389/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-18x04-in-the-blink-of-an-eye","name":"In the Blink of an Eye","season":18,"number":4,"airdate":"2020-04-16","airtime":"20:00","airstamp":"2020-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","runtime":60,"image":null,"summary":null,"show":{"id":575,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/575/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians","name":"Keeping Up with the Kardashians","type":"Reality","language":"English","genres":["Drama"],"status":"Running","runtime":60,"premiered":"2007-10-14","officialSite":"http://www.eonline.com/shows/kardashians","schedule":{"time":"20:00","days":["Thursday"]},"rating":{"average":3.5},"weight":98,"network":{"id":43,"name":"E!","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":17638,"thetvdb":80725,"imdb":"tt1086761"},"image":null,"summary":"<p><b>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</b> has grown steadily from a familial docu-series into a global phenomenon.
