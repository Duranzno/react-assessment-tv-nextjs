The show was created by veteran newsmen Robert MacNeil &amp; Jim Lehrer, and has been on the air since 1975. In 2009, the show, previously known as The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer, became PBS NewsHour. One of the major differences between network news and the PBS NewsHour is that because the show is publicly funded, there are no commercials. This allows the NewsHour to dedicate more time to comprehensive reporting.</p>",

summary: "<p><b>Port Protection</b> is home to the few who have left behind normal society and chosen a different life in a remote Alaskan community, where survival of the individuals and community cannot sustain without the other. The stakes are high. The land is rugged and unforgiving and the seas which surround Port Protection are cold and merciless. With risk comes a reward more profound than mere survival: a world of beauty and freedom with the security of community and without the constraints of bureaucracy. In Port Protection there are no clear roads to survival, inhabitants must carve one themselves.</p>",

On paper, they might seem like your average family...yet in person, they attract a lot of attention.... because all seven members of the Johnston family – Amber, Trent, their two biological children, Jonah and Elizabeth, as well as their three adopted children, Anna, Emma and Alex – happen to have Achondroplasia Dwarfism. Together, these spunky seven make up the largest known family of Achondroplastic dwarfs in the world, and even describe themselves as "the real life seven dwarfs".</p>",

summary: "<p>Stephen Colbert takes over as host of The Late Show on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and lest known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed The Colbert Report, which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!</p>",
